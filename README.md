# World Tree
A game in which the player restores the World Tree ‚Äî a sacred being that remembers all living things ‚Äî to its former glory. Each Tree Guardian must nurture the tree using what they‚Äôve cultivated. For a human, that means feeding it the seeds of the **fruit** they collect!

## Inspiration
The idea for this game actually came to me in early June, when I was cooking up video game ideas by the dozen. It was my first ever original video game, and so I wanted to start simple. To get on my feet I coded Flappy Bird, following the tutorial from [Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM), and adapted the things I had learned to my game in the spawning mechanics for the fruit. I progressed from there by learning how to add animations and coding the tree feeding script.

## Controls
- Use the **Left** and **Right Arrow Keys** to move around the screen.
- Most interactions are through a **click-based UI**: Feed the World Tree, navigate the area, and reset progress by clicking on buttons.

## Features
- **Collection System**: Gather mystical fruits and materials that spawn beneath the World Tree.
- **WebGL Compatible**: Play in your browser ‚Äî no download required!
- **Click - Based UI**: Drag-and-drop, buttons, and popups for intuitive play.
- **Stunning Pixel Art & Animations**.
- **Future plans** include coding a rotten fruit mechanic (which causes loss of Essence of Life) and a Timed Challenge mode.

## Gameplay
- The fruits you collect in this game are each worth a unique amount.
  - üçé Apples are worth 5 points and fall the slowest,
  - üçä Oranges are worth 10 points,
  - üçë Peaches are worth 15 points and fall the fastest!
- You have 5 lives - every time you fail to catch a fruit, you lose a life.
- Feed 2500x Essence of Life to the tree to fully restore it.
