# World Tree
A game in which the player restores the World Tree — a sacred being that remembers all living things — to its former glory. Each Tree Guardian must nurture the tree using what they’ve cultivated. For a human, that means feeding it the seeds of the **fruit** they collect!

## Controls
- Use the **Left** and **Right Arrow Keys** to move around the screen.
- Most interactions are through a **click-based UI**: Feed the World Tree, navigate the area, and reset progress by clicking on buttons.

## Features
- **Collection System**: Gather mystical fruits and materials that spawn beneath the World Tree.
- **WebGL Compatible**: Play in your browser — no download required!
- **Click-Based UI**: Drag-and-drop, buttons, and popups for intuitive play.
- **Stunning Pixel Art & Animations**

## Gameplay
- The fruits you collect in this game are each worth a unique amount.
  - Apples are worth 5 points and fall the slowest,
  - Oranges are worth 10 points,
  - Peaches are worth 15 points and fall the fastest!
- You have 5 lives - every time you fail to catch a fruit, you lose a life.
- Feed 2500x Essence of Life to the tree to fully restore it.
